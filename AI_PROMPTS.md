After reading the assignment instructions, I realized that I'm expected to build an app that enables real-time, bi-directional voice conversations between a human and an AI assistant.

To start, I’m asking ChatGPT-5.1 for help in this prompt.
```bash
I want to use LiveKit to enable real-time voice conversations between a human and an AI in the same room. When the user speaks through their microphone, the AI should immediately receive and process the audio, then respond with its own voice within the same LiveKit room.
```
